Operators
```
x = 5                                       x is 5
x + 5                                       x + 5
x - 5                                       x - 5 
x * 5                                       x * 5
x / 5                                       x / 5
x ** 5                                      x ^ 5
x % 7                                       x % 7
```

Comparators
```
x && y                                      x and y
x || y                                      x or y
x < y                                       x < y
x > y                                       x > y
x <= y                                      x <= y
x >= y                                      x >= y
x === y                                     x == y
x !== y                                     x != y
```

Print
```
console.log(x)                              output x
```

Conditionals
```
if (x == 0) {                               if x == 0
    console.log("False")                        output “False”
} else if (x == 1){                         else if x == 1
    console.log("True")                         output “True”
} else {                                    else
    console.log("Maybe?")                       output "Maybe?"
}
```

For Loop
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){               loop i from 0 to 10 by 1
    console.log(i)                              output i
}                                           end
```

While Loop
```
while (i != 10) {                           loop until i != 10
    console.log(5 * i)                          output 5 * i
}                                           end
```

Hello World
```
console.log("hello world")                  output "hello world"
```

Functions
```
function average(x, y){                     function average in: x, y
    let sum = x * y                             sum is x + y
    return sum / 2                              out: sum / 2
}
