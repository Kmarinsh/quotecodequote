  <p>qcq is a language that is made to allow you to use pseuodocode for programming.</p>

        Our team wanted to remove as many barriers as possible in writing code. We want the exact thoughts in your head to work as an actual 
        language. By making it as clear as possible, removing as many non-letter characters as possible, and making it dynamically typed, 
        we enable you to simply say exactly what is happening. No more must you struggle to find the correct syntax. YOU ALREADY KNOW IT.
      </p>

        Every computer science student has sat with a deadline creeping closer, wondering how in the heck their code is not working. Well, 
        using qcq, that problem does not exist. Convoluted code is a thing of the past! No need to waste paper writing down your pseuodocode.
        Your pseudocode is good enough!
