  <h2>You may be asking... why would anyone do this?</h2>
   <p>
     Our team wanted to remove as many barriers as possible in writing code. We want the exact thoughts in your head to work as an actual language. By 
     making it as clear as possible, removing as many non-letter characters as possible, and making it dynamically typed, 
     we enable you to simply say exactly what is happening. No more must you struggle to find the correct syntax. YOU ALREADY KNOW IT.
